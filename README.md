# Musical Pie v0.5!
Do you have a Subsonic-compatible server? No, probably not. How about an RFID RC522 reader and abundance of NFC stickers? Bit more likely but probably not. A 16x2 LCD? Maybe? A Raspberry Pi? Quite likely!

Well, if you're like me and have all of the above, you can use my Musical Pie project!!

Musical Pie is a Python program that will play music that's attached to NFC stickers from a subsonic server.

A sticker could reference an artist, album or track. When the sticker is scanned on the reader, it will play the music. Headphones/aux and USB speakers are supported. I also added a potentiometer for volume control.


In the full release, there'll be two push buttons for toggling play/pause and for skipping to the next song.
